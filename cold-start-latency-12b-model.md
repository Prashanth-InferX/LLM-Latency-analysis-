# Fastest Cold Start Latency for 12B+ Language Models

Cold start latency is the time it takes for a large language model (LLM) to initialize and be ready for inference—vital for on-demand scaling. For 12B+ parameter models (e.g., Llama 2 13B), what's the fastest achievable latency in the market as of March 2025?

## Key Finding
The fastest cold start latency is around **10 seconds**, based on optimized platforms like Anyscale. This estimate comes from proportional scaling (e.g., Llama 2 70B loads in <60s) and community reports with high-end setups.

## How It’s Achieved
- **Hardware**: GPUs with sufficient VRAM (e.g., RTX 4090 24GB), fast NVMe SSDs (~7 GB/s read).
- **Software**: Optimizations like safetensors, parallel loading, and quantization (e.g., 4-bit reduces Llama 13B to ~6.5 GB).
- **Setup**: Platforms like Anyscale use caching and efficient weight loading.

## Data Points
| Model       | Setup                  | Latency         | Notes                              |
|-------------|------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------|
| Llama 2 13B | Anyscale (estimated)   | ~10-15s         | Scaled from 70B data              |
| Llama 2 13B | Consumer GPU (optimized) | ~5.7-30s      | Depends on VRAM and quantization  |
| Llama 2 70B | Anyscale               | <60s            | 20x faster than baseline          |

## Why It Matters
For serverless or cloud-native AI, minimizing cold starts enhances responsiveness. Unoptimized setups can take minutes, but with the right stack, 12B+ models are ready in seconds.
